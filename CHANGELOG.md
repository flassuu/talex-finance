## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-10

### Added

- Android app skeleton with Material 3, dynamic color and a bottom bar with a
  center quick-add and a trailing menu.
- First-run wizard for the master passphrase and base currency, plus passphrase
  and biometric unlock.
- Encrypted local database with Room over SQLCipher; the key is derived from the
  master passphrase with Argon2id.
- Account list and account creation with an opening balance, stored as a system
  entry.
- Automatic re-lock after one minute in the background and on every cold start.
- Screenshots and the recents preview are blocked, and the app requests no
  network permission.
- English base and Ukrainian translation for the first-run and account screens.
- Documentation foundation: product plan, architecture, database, security,
  ledger, roadmap, decision log and ADRs 0001-0020.

### Fixed

- Biometric unlock saves the wrapped database key on the first passphrase
  unlock, so the biometric button appears on later launches.
